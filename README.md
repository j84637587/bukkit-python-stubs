# Bukkit Python Stubs

Python `.pyi` stubs for the Minecraft Bukkit API (`org.bukkit`).
These stubs are auto-generated to provide **type hints**, **autocompletion**, and **static analysis** support in Python environments, specifically with the [PySpigot](https://github.com/magicmq/pyspigot) project.

## Features

These `.pyi` stubs are useful if you're:
- Writing Bukkit plugins with Jython or Java interop.
- Needing autocompletion and type hints for Bukkit classes in Python editors.
- Works with [PySpigot](https://github.com/magicmq/pyspigot) to develop Minecraft plugins in Python.


## Source

These stubs are auto-generated from the 	official repository of [SpigotMC](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects) repo using GPT-4.
